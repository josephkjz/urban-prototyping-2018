Background of Site

The site straddles between the One-north development to the East, Singapore Polytechnic and Residential Developments to the North and the National University of Singapore’s University Town(uTown) to the West. 


On the Southern border is expressway which becomes an impermeable urban barrier separating the site from the Southern developments.


One North Development
The One North development has been masterplanned as a research and business park for research innovation and test-bedding. Tucked in closest proximity to the site is the start up scene of JTC’s launchpad development.

The masterplan designed by Zaha Hadid has a dynamic green spine that flows through it, which helps to enhance the dynamic urban form of the plots, creating an energetic form that meets in the central spine, with surprising pockets of large and small green spaces that weaves in and out for people to appropriate the space.

NUS uTown
The university town is designed as a space for learning, and has been designed around a central green space called uTown green. The town integrates research laboratories, innovative business labs, undergraduate and graduate hostels, and learning spaces to create a dynamic space for the cross pollination of ideas

The Site
As a site that straddles between an important education institution which people enter before entering into work, and the innovation focused business park in one north, the site presents potential as a meeting ground between the university and the one-north development, to become a site for the cross pollination of ideas, hybridisation. Given Singapore’s government’s emphasis on entrepreneurship, the site presents a great opportunity for university students and industry experts and innovators to meet and collaborate. 

Given the unique opportunity for cross pollination and hybridisation of programmes that could occur from the mixing of the programmes, the project seeks to find an urban form that is as dynamic as the one created in the One north development to connect One-north to uTown. 

The Challenge
The brief requires the area to be planned for the following parameters:

No of People: 75 000
Area of each person: 35 sqm/person

a. Residential 22sqm   b. Office 5sqm  c. Commercial 4sqm  d. Industrial  4sqm

The site is a 75 hectare site.

The high density of the site creates quite a challenge:
For the hybridisation of the different programmes to occur, the public spaces must be designed in a way which allows people to spill out and appropriate them. The scale has to be human scale, with spaces where people can spill out from their buildings into the human scale public spaces. At the same time, it still has to accomodate the high densities of people on the site.

In order to resolve the tension between the high gfa and human scale public space, and performance of the different spaces, the solution would possibly have to be a mix of very tall buildings, together with shorter buildings.


Design Approach
Continuing the dynamic language of the green spine public space in one-north, the design connects the unversity and industry by translating it into a curved commercial spline that weaves through the site. The dynamic curved commercial spline, creates a dynamic new public domain for people in the two different domains to traverse through, and meet. 

The commercial spline is not to be understood as a typical commercial spline, but can be understood more as a space that supports the needs of new entrepreneurs who want to connect with new customers, while meeting people who may be interested in their project from either the school or industry, to become partners in their projects. As a result, the commercial spline,has to be designed with the potential for the organization of informal bazaars, parties and events for people from the university and industry to meet. It has to be an energetic space, which is able to allow for meaningful finer scaled appropriation for events. Outdoor movie screenings, gig performances and community events are imagined to occur in this public domain.

This led to the concept of the urban weave.

The project was developed in three stages:

* Stage 1: Dynamic Urban weave of urban plots of differing sizes that weaves the sites together
* Stage 2: Weaving the Urban form of the different programmes together, with a strong visual spine anchored by the central commercial strip. In addition, to reinforce the opportunities for hybiridisation and use by designing semi-public courtyards along this central spine where pop ups and special activities can occur.
* Stage 3: Developing the Urban Typologies to improve the performance of the urban form.

As a whole, the three stages helps to improve the narrative of the urban weave at the different scales of the site, the different zones and finally at the scale of the building. In addition, it was found that the iterative process helped to improve the urban form even as it improved the performance of the buildings.
